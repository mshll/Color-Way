/**
 This collectionViewLayout will behave as a *LNZSnapToCenterCollectionViewLayout* with the exception that it
 will behave as infinite scrolling. Elements will repeat themselves allowing the user to scroll horizontally
 in any direction. The items in the collection will not really be reordered or duplicated, but the attributes
 for the collection cells will be computed to have a different frame depending on the scroll position.
 The snap to center behavior can be disabled. If the number of elements or the size is too small to avoid the
 same object to appear twice between the visible items, then the layout will behave like a normal
 *LNZSnapToCenterCollectionViewLayout* or a normal UICollectionViewFlowLayout if the snap to center was disabled.
